# The Future of Roblox Codes: What Types Will Emerge in 2025?

## 1. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Codes

As AR and VR technologies advance, Roblox is likely to introduce codes that support these innovations. These codes could enable developers to create immersive gaming experiences, such as exploring 3D virtual worlds through VR or integrating game elements into real-world environments via AR.

## 5. Sustainability-Themed Codes

With a rising focus on sustainability, Roblox may release codes related to environmental education. These could be used to create games centered around eco-friendly challenges, such as recycling simulations or ecological preservation games.

---

## 6. Low-Code/No-Code Development Tools

To lower the barriers to game development, Roblox might introduce low-code or no-code tools that allow more users to create their own games. These tools could make it easier for non-programmers to contribute to the community by designing games and experiences.
